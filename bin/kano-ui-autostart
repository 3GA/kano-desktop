#  kano-ui-autostart
#
#  This is the Kano version of Lightdm autostart script, which runs once per boot,
#  and each time a successful Greeter login takes place.
#
#  It decides wether to go into Dashboard or Desktop mode via systemd services.
#  Allows for switching between the two very fast, because lightdm is never restarted.
#
#  This script replaces kano-uixinit, which moves into systemd services,
#  (look at the systemd subdirectory)
#
#  To switch from either mode, do:
#
#  $ systemctl --user isolate kano-dasbhoard / kano-desktop
#
#  Preferably, use the dashboard tool: kano-dashboard-uimode <dashboard|desktop>
#

# We want systemd to populate the environment to user services
# FIXME: MANAGERPID is not exported, SHLVL=2 instead of 1. why?
