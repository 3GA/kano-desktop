#  kano-ui-autostart
#
#  This is the Kano version of Lightdm autostart script, which runs once per boot,
#  and each time a successful Greeter login takes place.
#
#  It decides wether to go into Dashboard or Desktop mode via systemd services.
#  Allows for switching between the two very fast, because lightdm is never restarted.
#
#  This script replaces kano-uixinit, which moves into systemd services,
#  (look at the systemd subdirectory)
#
#  To switch from either mode, do:
#
#  $ systemctl --user isolate kano-dasbhoard / kano-desktop
#
#  Preferably, use the dashboard tool: kano-dashboard-uimode <dashboard|desktop>
#

# We want systemd to populate the environment to user services
# FIXME: MANAGERPID is not exported, SHLVL=2 instead of 1. why?
export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1
systemctl --user import-environment

# Are we on a RaspberryPI 2 or above?

RPI_2_B_SCORE ; print has_min_performance(RPI_2_B_SCORE)"`

# By default always go to the Dashboard Mode, except if switching to Desktop Mode,
# or the Raspberry model is below RPi2B, because Dashboard is not supported.
